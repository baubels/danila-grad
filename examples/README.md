To run the examples:
- Download MNIST: MNIST_trainX.npy, MNIST_trainy.npy, and english-german-both.pkl, placing them into project_dir/data/.
- from project_dir, run PYTHONPATH=. python tests/{cnn,dnn,transformer}/train.py

Per epoch model results will be saved in tests/{cnn,dnn,transformer}/model_saves/
