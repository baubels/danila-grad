### Examples

Examples have been created for producing DNN, CNN, and Transformer architectures using the `Tensor` class.

1. Download the data folder [data (GDrive)](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1E26iVyOqndHzKWLyhZ08v63M7aTJoYSQ?usp=sharing) and place it in the repo's root directory. This downloads MNIST for the DNN/CNN and an English-German translation dataset for the Transformer.
2. Install new dependencies.
3. Run `python examples/{cnn,dnn,transformer}/train.py`.

Per-epoch model results will save in corresponding directory containing `train.py`.
