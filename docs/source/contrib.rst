Contributors / Collaboration
=============================

Thank you for your interest in this project! 
As the sole maintainer, I am currently not accepting pull requests or code contributions, 
but I will reviewing:
    * bugs, or serious flaw reports, 
    * feature requests,
    * documentation suggestions,
    * and any other suggestions.

**If you have feature requests**

Please note that ``pygrad`` is a lightweight library with few dependencies. 
It should also be simple and easy to use. I want to keep it this way.
I am not looking to replace PyTorch or Tensorflow.

**How to Submit an Issue:**
    * Include as much detail as possible.
    * Check existing issues to ensure you don't submit a duplicate.
    * For bug reports: include steps to reproduce, expected behaviour, and actual behaviour.
    * For feature requests: describe the feature in detail and how it would benefit the project.
    * For suggestions: describe the suggestion, and why it might be relevant.

**What Happens After You Submit an Issue:**

I will review and implement if accepted.
If there are discussions, implementation decisions will wait until discussions are resolved.
